TIPS FOR EFFECTIVE TESTIMONY:

✓ PRACTICE with a timer - 2 minutes goes FAST
✓ Bring 10 copies of your written testimony to hand to council members
✓ Speak slowly and clearly - they're taking notes
✓ Make eye contact with council members
✓ Stay calm and professional, even if others get emotional
✓ Don't repeat what previous speakers said - add new information
✓ Stick to facts - emotion is okay, but lead with data
✓ Address the council, not other audience members
✓ If interrupted by time limit, finish your sentence and stop

✗ DON'T attack individuals personally
✗ DON'T make claims you can't back up with sources
✗ DON'T go over time - you'll be cut off and lose credibility
✗ DON'T speak from anger - it undermines your message
