## Tips for Effective Communication

### Writing to Elected Officials

1. **Be concise** - One page maximum
2. **State your position clearly** - Support or oppose in the first paragraph
3. **Use facts** - Reference specific studies, data, or local impacts
4. **Make it personal** - Explain how this issue affects you and your family
5. **Be respectful** - Professional tone gets better results
6. **Include contact information** - Address, phone, email
7. **Follow up** - Call to confirm receipt and ask for response

### Public Testimony Best Practices

1. **Arrive early** - Sign up to speak as soon as possible
2. **Time limits** - Usually 2-3 minutes, practice your statement
3. **Written copy** - Bring copies to hand out to council members
4. **State your name and address** - Required at most meetings
5. **Stick to facts** - Emotion is fine, but lead with data
6. **Specific asks** - What action do you want them to take?
7. **Dress professionally** - Shows respect for the process

### Open Records Requests

1. **Be specific** - Exact documents, date ranges, department
2. **Reasonable scope** - Overly broad requests can be denied
3. **Expect delays** - 10 business days minimum, complex requests take longer
4. **Know your rights** - Denials must cite specific legal exemption
5. **Appeal if denied** - You can request Attorney General review
