Data centers are often called the factories of the digital age, but unlike traditional manufacturing, their environmental footprint is less visible to the casual observer. One of the most significant yet under-discussed impacts is water consumption.

## The Scale of Water Usage

Modern hyperscale data centers - the type being proposed for our 520-acre site - can consume between 1-5 million gallons of water per day for cooling purposes. To put this in perspective:

- That's equivalent to the daily water usage of 30,000-100,000 people
- In drought-prone Texas, this represents a significant strain on local aquifers
- Water used for cooling is often lost to evaporation and not returned to the water table

## How Data Centers Use Water

Most large data centers use water in cooling towers to dissipate the massive amounts of heat generated by servers. The process works like this:

1. Hot water from the data center is sprayed over cooling tower fill material
2. Air is drawn through the tower, evaporating some of the water
3. The cooled water is circulated back to cool the servers
4. Fresh water must constantly be added to replace what's lost to evaporation

## Impact on Rural Communities

Our community faces unique challenges:

- **Limited Infrastructure**: Rural water systems weren't designed for industrial-scale consumption
- **Competing Demands**: Agriculture, ranching, and residential needs already strain resources
- **Drought Vulnerability**: Texas has experienced severe droughts, with more predicted due to climate change
- **Aquifer Depletion**: Heavy extraction can lower water tables, affecting wells and natural springs

## What We're Asking For

We're not anti-technology or anti-development. We're asking for:

1. Transparent water usage reporting and monitoring
2. Investment in water recycling and conservation technology
3. Binding commitments to protect local water resources
4. Environmental impact studies specific to our region's hydrology

The technology industry has the resources to innovate. We believe they should be held to the highest standards when locating in water-stressed rural areas.
