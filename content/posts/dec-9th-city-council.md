On December 9th, 2025, the Lacy Lakeview City Council demonstrated exactly why citizen engagement cannot be optional, cannot be polite, and cannot wait for permission.

In a two-minute span, the council voted 6-1 to approve a memorandum of understanding with InfraKey—a nonbinding agreement to annex 520 acres and provide water infrastructure for a $10 billion data center. They cast this vote *before* allowing a single resident to speak.

Over 60 opponents packed the council chambers and overflowed into the hallway. They came prepared to be heard. The council made sure they wouldn't be heard when it mattered.

"Are y'all listening?" someone called out after the vote. "We'd like to speak... We came to speak!"

They would eventually get their turn—12 speakers against, one for. But by then, the decision was already made.

## When Democracy Becomes Theater

This wasn't an oversight. This was a choice.

The council knew what they were doing when they structured the agenda this way. Vote first, listen later. Let the public comment period become a venting session instead of actual input into governance.

And here's what makes it worse: Lacy Lakeview plans to annex land that isn't even contiguous to their city limits. Land currently in unincorporated McLennan County and Waco's extraterritorial jurisdiction. Land where people live who will never vote in Lacy Lakeview elections, never benefit from Lacy Lakeview's tax windfall, never receive Lacy Lakeview city services.

Those residents—our neighbors in Ross, in Elm Mott, in the unincorporated county—will get the noise pollution, the air pollution from a 1.2-gigawatt gas-fired power plant, the traffic, the industrial blight. Lacy Lakeview gets an estimated $50 million per year in tax revenue.

Mayor Charles Wilson said it himself: "It would be the most irresponsible thing we could do" to walk away from this deal.

Translation: No amount of community opposition, environmental concern, or regional impact will change their minds. The money is too good.

"You sold us out!" a woman called from the audience.

"You sold Ross and Elm Mott out," said another.

"Nobody's been sold out," Wilson responded.

## Why Public Outcry Is Necessary

That crowd of 60+ people in the room and hallway? They accomplished something critical even though the vote went against them.

Waco City Manager Bradley Ford and Assistant City Manager Ryan Holt attended the meeting. Ford told [The Waco Bridge](https://wacobridge.org/2025/12/10/tensions-high-lacy-lakeview-data-center-vote/) afterward that Waco officials only learned about the project details and annexation plans "in recent weeks through coverage by The Waco Bridge."

Think about that. This project could require up to 16 million gallons of water per day from Waco's supply. The land is currently in Waco's ETJ. And Waco officials found out by reading the news.

"I think any time you have a project of this scale that affects all the regional partners, affects the county, affects multiple communities like we heard tonight, you would hope that we'd be at the table much earlier," Ford said. "That didn't happen... (and) that's highly unusual."

Public pressure forced this into the light. Without that turnout, without the media coverage, without citizens demanding answers, this deal moves forward in the shadows.

The fight isn't over because people showed up.

## Why Written Comments Matter

Here's the practical reality: A 53-person room can't hold 100+ concerned citizens. A typical city council meeting can't accommodate 60 people giving three-minute public comments. And as we saw on December 9th, councils can structure their agendas to render public comment meaningless.

This is why written public comments are essential:

**They enter the official record before votes happen.** Submit comments in advance, and they're part of the official record that council members must acknowledge before taking action.

**They create documentation.** When this fight escalates to county commissioners, state representatives, or legal challenges, those written comments become evidence. Evidence of community opposition. Evidence of specific concerns raised. Evidence of officials ignoring their constituents.

**They reach everyone who matters.** Your written testimony can go to city council, county commissioners, state legislators, and federal representatives simultaneously. One well-prepared comment has exponential reach.

**They level the playing field.** InfraKey's spokesperson had exact figures ready—water usage projections, buildout timelines, economic impact numbers. Meanwhile, residents were asking for "more time to research." Written comments let you bring the research, the data, the legal citations. You show up prepared with facts, not just passion.

## Why Preparation Is Key

Passion matters. But passion without precision gets dismissed.

Several speakers on December 9th pleaded for more time to study the impacts, asked the council to "press pause," raised concerns about water and air quality. All valid. All important. But when InfraKey's representative counters with specific numbers and Lacy Lakeview officials cite economic projections, vague concerns don't carry the same weight.

This is why our template library exists. We've done the research. We've identified the legal frameworks. We've outlined the environmental impacts, the water supply constraints, the procedural violations.

When you submit a public comment citing Texas Local Government Code §43.052 about annexation requirements, or referencing Texas Water Code provisions about regional water planning, or documenting EPA air quality standards that this plant may violate—that's harder to ignore.

When you show up to public comment with printed copies of your written testimony, with citations, with data—you're not just another concerned citizen. You're someone who did their homework.

## Sarah Lenart: The Response This Situation Demands

While the council conducted its carefully choreographed performance—vote first, pretend to listen later—Sarah Lenart refused to play along.

She interrupted Mayor Wilson's closing speech about "the inevitability of change" and the "nature of economic growth." Lacy Lakeview police officers escorted her from the meeting.

The optics tell the story: Police removing a citizen for objecting too loudly to her community being sold out—after the council voted before letting anyone speak.

Sarah did what the situation called for. Not disruption for its own sake. Not incivility for attention. But the direct, uncompromising opposition that a corrupt process demands.

When a city council votes before hearing from the people they plan to steamroll, when they're hellbent on annexing non-contiguous land to capture $10 billion in tax revenue without any obligation to the people affected, when they make it clear that no amount of public testimony will change their minds—polite comments for the record aren't enough.

Sarah's removal should radicalize every person who believes in democratic governance. Not toward violence. Not toward chaos. But toward the recognition that this fight requires everything we can bring to it.

## The Path Forward

The December 9th meeting revealed several critical facts:

**Regional partners are now aware and concerned.** Waco officials calling this "highly unusual" is political leverage. Use it. Copy them on every communication. Document every instance where regional coordination was bypassed.

**The process is flawed and documented.** Council voted before public comment. That's now part of the official record. Every procedural shortcut becomes evidence when you escalate to county and state levels.

**Lacy Lakeview has already decided.** Mayor Wilson said walking away would be "the most irresponsible thing we could do." They're committed. Your audience isn't Lacy Lakeview council anymore—it's everyone else with actual power to stop this.

County commissioners who can challenge the annexation. State representatives who can investigate the ETJ manipulation. Federal representatives who can examine the environmental and infrastructure impacts. Media outlets who can expose the backroom dealing. Waco officials who control the water supply.

Every one of them needs to hear from you. In writing. With documentation. With specific asks.

## What You Can Do

1. **Submit written testimony** to Lacy Lakeview City Council for their next meeting. Use our [templates](/resources/templates-contact-info) if you need a starting point.

2. **Contact county commissioners** about the annexation of non-contiguous land in unincorporated county territory. Our template library includes county-specific letters.

3. **Write to your state representatives** about HB 2965 being misused to bypass regional planning. Templates available in the resource library.

4. **Document everything.** Attend meetings if you can. Submit written comments whether you attend or not. Keep copies. Share them with us.

5. **Spread the word.** The public pressure that got Waco officials to that December 9th meeting? That only works if people know what's happening.

This fight isn't over. It's just getting started.

And when future generations ask what we did when our community was being sold out, when our rural home was being industrialized without our consent, when our voices were silenced by procedural tricks—we'll point to people like Sarah Lenart who refused to sit quietly.

We'll show them the written record of opposition. The documentation of every meeting, every vote, every public comment ignored.

We'll prove that we fought for this place. With facts, with persistence, with the full measure of civic engagement that democracy demands.

Your voice matters. Make sure it's heard.
