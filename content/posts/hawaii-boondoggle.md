### January 13 Was Not Annexation. It Was a Warning Shot.

Let's get the facts straight first, because the media sure didn't.

On January 13, 2026, Lacy Lakeview did NOT approve annexation for Infrakey's data center. They approved Resolution 2026-01, a routine January resolution that lays out how annexation requests may be handled during the year. It annexed nothing. Infrakey wasn't even on the agenda.

That part matters. And it also does not mean everything is fine.

Because when you look at what the city has already signed, and what they did next, January 13 starts to look like the calm before a very intentional storm.

#### Confusion by Design

People didn't misunderstand January 13 by accident.

When a city signs a massive non-binding MOU in December, votes before public comment, limits disclosure, answers questions vaguely, and then acts offended when residents assume the next vote is connected, that is not confusion. That's strategy.

You don't get to operate in a fog and then scold people for not seeing clearly.

And then came Hawaii.

### The Hawaii Boondoggle

While residents in Elm Mott, Ross, and Lacy Lakeview were still asking basic questions like where the water comes from and who controls the power, City Manager Calvin Hodde was in Honolulu at the Pacific Telecommunications Council conference.

Not observing. Not learning.

Announcing.

The L2D2 project was formally rolled out at PTC '26 as if it were a settled deal, a done project, a sure thing. All while the city does not yet have annexation, does not control the site, does not have finalized water or power agreements, and does not have binding contracts approved by council.

That is not leadership. That is a sales pitch.

This project was not announced first to the people whose land, water, roads, and grid will be impacted. It was announced to telecom executives in Hawaii. On the city's time. With the city's blessing. While residents at home were still being told to "wait for more information."

If you are a city manager and you fly to Hawaii to promote a project your city does not yet have the legal authority to execute, you have failed your job. Period.

For that alone, Calvin Hodde should resign.

### The P4 Power Model: Never Tried, Never Tested, Never Safe

Now let's talk about what's actually in the MOU, because this is where the alarm bells should be deafening.

The document explicitly states that this project is intended to be the nation's first Public-Private Power (P4) utility ecosystem. First. As in never done before. No precedent. No case studies. No cities to point to and say "see, it worked."

Under this model, Infrakey or its utility special-purpose entities design, finance, build, own, and operate power, gas, water, wastewater, cooling, and fiber systems. The city's role is "municipal sponsorship and oversight."

That sounds nice until you read the fine print.

The MOU defines a prospective utility franchise term of **fifty years**.

Fifty years.

That is not normal. That is not conservative. That is not prudent infrastructure planning.

Think about cell towers. Think about early broadband contracts. Think about water systems built in the 70s that cities are still untangling today. Those deals were 10, maybe 20 years, and many of them are now considered mistakes. Technology changed. Needs changed. Communities changed.

Now imagine locking critical infrastructure to a private operator for half a century, in a sector that evolves faster than almost any other on earth.

No exit ramp is clearly defined. No ownership transfer terms are spelled out. No affordable buyout path is guaranteed. What is clear is exclusivity, long duration, and control resting with the developer.

That is not partnership. That is dependency.

### Fifty Years Is a Lifetime in Infrastructure

The MOU states the city would grant exclusive rights within the project footprint, meaning no competing provider, no alternative utility option, no leverage if service degrades or rates climb.

Rates are to be set using CPI-linked formulas and pass-through provisions for costs and law changes. That means rates go up, almost never down. Over fifty years, that matters.

And if Infrakey stumbles financially, the agreement allows collateral assignment to lenders, with step-in rights for banks or investors. Translation: if this goes sideways, Lacy Lakeview could end up dealing with a financial institution instead of the original developer, with even less accountability and zero community obligation.

The city also agreed that engineering studies, models, and technical data remain Infrakey's intellectual property. That means public records requests can be denied, disclosure limited, and residents kept in the dark about the very systems that control their water and power.

You cannot regulate what you cannot see.

## Ross Did It Right

On the same night, Ross handled this the responsible way.

They asked their attorney. They reviewed options. They acknowledged they do not have the water capacity for a project that needs 15 to 16 million gallons a day. And they tabled everything until they actually understand the consequences.

Mayor Jim Jaska said it plainly. The people of Lacy Lakeview are the ones who can apply pressure. He was right.

## The Bottom Line

January 13 did not approve annexation. But it exposed a pattern.

A city rushing ahead of its residents. Leadership selling a vision to outsiders before answering questions at home. An untested power model wrapped in fifty-year commitments that future councils and residents will be stuck with long after the current decision-makers are gone.

There are now 2,867 signatures opposing this project (as of the date of this article). That is easily more than one third of the city's population. That is more votes than any council member received.

This is not economic development. It is economic surrender.

Calvin Hodde should resign.

The City Council should stop, slow down, and refuse any binding agreements until full disclosure, environmental review, and independent legal analysis are completed.

And residents should keep showing up.

Because once this infrastructure is built, there is no undo button.
