Last night's city council meeting brought significant developments in the data center proposal. Here's what happened and what it means for our community.

## Key Takeaways

### Zoning Variance Request
The developer formally submitted their request for a zoning variance to allow industrial development on agricultural land. The variance hearing is scheduled for **December 28th at 6:00 PM**.

**Why this matters**: This is our first official opportunity for public comment on the record. Your presence and testimony are crucial.

### Water Rights Discussion
Councilmember Rodriguez raised concerns about water allocation, specifically:
- Current water system capacity assessments
- Need for independent environmental impact study
- Protection of agricultural water rights

**Council Response**: Split 3-2 vote to request a third-party water impact study before proceeding. Study timeline: 60-90 days.

### Developer Presentation
The development company presented their case, highlighting:
- $2 billion capital investment
- Claims of 200 permanent jobs
- Promise of $50 million annual property tax revenue

**Our Analysis**: These numbers warrant scrutiny. See our [Economic Impact blog post](/posts/economic-impact-jobs/) for context from similar projects.

## What Was NOT Discussed

Several critical issues were conspicuously absent from the official agenda:
- Traffic impact on Farm Road 308
- Electrical grid capacity and reliability for existing residents
- Agricultural land preservation policies
- Long-term community character and quality of life

## Public Comment Highlights

**Sarah Henderson** (local rancher): Testified about existing well water levels declining and concerns about aquifer depletion.

**Marcus Williams** (County Extension Agent): Provided data on agricultural economic contribution - current 520 acres support 8 family farms employing 30+ people.

**David Chen** (IT professional, relocated from California): Offered perspective on similar development in his former community, warning about infrastructure strain and property value impacts.
